### Overview
This application will allow users to compare presidential candidates based on each candidates proposals for comminly discussed issues. Users will also be able to group and view all candidates based on commonalities in policy proposals and political experience. I was inspired to create this application last year when I realized that a lot of political discourse is inaccessible to the average internet user. The rapid speed of the internet and the 24 hour news cycle can make it difficult and tiring to keep up with every moment of an election cycle. This app, however, will provide access to nonbiased information on mundane topics that Americans are concerned about so each person can make more informed political decisions. 

### Features
<ul>
  <li> Display: Users will be able to view every presidential candidate. </li>
  <li> Compare: Users will be able to select from a list of presidential candidates to see a compare/contrast view of each candidate </li>
  <li> Social Media:  Users will be able to share results from comparison view to their social media to encourage traffic to the site </li>
  <li> Candidates: Users will be able to view candidates based on their response to selected issue groups </li>
</ul>

### Technologies
<ul> 
  <li> Python </li>
  <li> Flask</li>
  <li> MySQL </li>
  <li> SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li> Jinja2 Templates </li>
  <li> JavaScript </li> 
</ul>

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn Javascript and become more acquainted with front-end design to make the user experience as appealing snd efficient as possible. I will also have to learn to connect to APIs so I can use social media APIs to allow users to share their research on their social media profiles and Google Civic to query information about the candidates.
